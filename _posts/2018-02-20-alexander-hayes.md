My work is mostly centered on relational approaches to natural language processing. Approaches such as word2vec have increased interest in the context that words appear in beyond the bag-of-words model. The approach we focus on models the relations between words, document structure, and word attributes like part-of-speech; which can provide powerful insights for classification tasks.
