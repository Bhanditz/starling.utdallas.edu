We are interested in making smart machines that humans can use reliably in their everyday lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress since its early days, and its advancement has helped shape the progress of research in many other fields. Traditionally, AI is used with either the logical approach (to address structured problems) or with the statistical approach (to handle uncertainty). Our research interests lie at the intersection: advancement and application of [algorithms that can do both](http://github.com/boost-starai/BoostSRL).
