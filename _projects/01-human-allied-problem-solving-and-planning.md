As we create more sophisticated decision-making machines that can solve problems and learn from observations in a noisy, dynamic, and stochastic world; we want to augment or support human effort in almost all areas of knowledge. It becomes clearer that observations and data alone may not be enough even in the age of big data. For instance, sequential decision making systems which learn from observed human behavior may suffer from the effects of systematic noise, or the ones that learn from partially observable world models do not have access to all of the features that can fully represent the state of the world. Prediction systems that learn from structured representations of objects and interactions suffer from the implicit statistical skew in the data--resulting in suboptimal hypotheses. Problem-solving and planning systems suffer from asymmetry of capabilities: an autonomous planning agent planning for a fire rescue scenario may have building and city schematics and vast computational power, but it may not know how to prioritize different tasks: does it save a survivor or put the flames out? Experts may implicitly understand these things through their years of experience; we want to leverage the decades of knowledge assimilated by domain experts for better learning and decision making, therefore our methods attempt to balance between data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches.

Though knowledge-augmented predictive systems are not new, recent years have witnessed a major research thrust in their direction. Our group is an active contributor to this cause, focusing on leveraging expert knowledge in predictive systems from structured noisy data (SRL) in sequential decision making (reinforcement learning) to facilitate learning of optimal behaviors, in systems where better solutions are needed. We build frameworks for various representations and types of expert knowledge/advice/guidance or the real-time elicitation of such knowledge at learning/inference time from potentially many people. We have also shown that successful applications to real-world problems, especially healthcare and finance.
